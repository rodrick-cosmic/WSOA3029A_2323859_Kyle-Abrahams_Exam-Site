             The following essay will function as part-summary, part-reflection and aims to examine Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin’s 2020 essay, What is Interaction for Data Visualization?</p>
      
      <p> <br> The paper opens with establishing the point of investigation, "What is interaction?", or rather “What is interaction in relation to visualization”. Historically, neither of these questions have been particularly easy to answer, as there exists very little understanding of interaction in relation to Human Computer Interaction (HCI). More recently, a review was published which describes the inherent ‘causal linkages’ that exist between humans and computers. While this review discusses ways to improve interaction, it is unknown how these principles relate to visualization in computer systems. 

      <p> <br> As a result, even if visualization researchers and practitioners are aware of such interaction notions, they are more often than not able to understand how to apply them to their own data-driven activities and expectations. Meanwhile over the previous decade, there has been an increasing demand to increase interaction in visualization systems. To capture the view of interaction in visualization, the writers started with a list of papers based on their own expertise and expert input. They then fed these papers to an algorithm. Before finally, the writers presented the summary statistics of the review. (Dimara & Perin, 2020). </p>
      <p> <br> Methodology Rationale: It is an obvious the topic of interaction in visualization is extensive; arguably, most visualization research involves interaction at some point. As a result, the Dimara & Perin abandon the systematic review in favour of a critical evaluation, which they claim does not have to be exhaustive but does need a more detailed examination of the literature. The writers break down the three criterion listed below as a means of as part of the rationale:
      <p> <br> R1: The involvement of the community cannot be expressed only via citation number; expert input is essential. 
      <p> <br> R2: The snowballing technique (starting with a set of seed papers and expanding through back- and forward-references) is insufficient since it is impacted by seed paper selection. </p>

      <p> <br> R3: The review may include no HCI research that are not connected to visualization. </p>

      <br>

      <p> <br> Method for Tagging Papers with Interaction Themes </p>

      <br>

      <p> <br> Dimara & Perin develop tags to characterize the ‘seed’ and ‘linked’ publications using an iterative deductive coding technique. They supposedly discovered emergent themes by reading ‘seed’ articles with the goal of capturing: 1. “the current view of interaction in visualization” (Dimara & Perin, 2020) ; 2. community-identified problems; and 3. “existing archetypal descriptions and categorizations of interactions.” (Dimara & Perin, 2020). The tags are as follows. </p>

      <p> <br> Definition of Interaction: effort to define, explain, or describe interaction. A 1 represents implicit efforts, which include definitions based on certain qualities or aspects of interaction.
      <p> <br> Critical on Interaction: complains and frustrations about interaction (in a negative tone) to indicate areas for development and obstacles. A 1 represents brief complaints. </p>
      <p> <br> Benefits of Interaction: beneficial features of interaction (real or expected). A grade of 1 denotes brief (or modestly stated) benefits discussions. </p>

      <p> <br> Interaction Concepts: archetype interaction description awarded to articles that offer one of the following: "idea", "model", "framework", "design space", or "paradigm". A idea with a rating of 1 has a small or uncertain relationship to interaction. (Dimara & Perin, 2020). </p>
      <p> <br> Interactive Pipeline: interaction in respect to the visualization pipeline, a basic idea that spans visualization sub-domains and specifically incorporates interaction</p>
      <p> <br> List: a list's contribution (e.g., of interaction techniques, tasks, or intents). A formal list is one that is defined by one of the following words: "taxonomy", "classification", "typology", or "categorization"(Dimara & Perin, 2020). </p>
      <p> <br> Allow us to shift focus to the main question posed by the paper, what is interaction. As a definition that we can inform our understanding around. According to the Cambridge dictionary, interaction refers to an occasion when two or more people or things communicate with or react to each other. Now in the context of data visualisation we can understand that interaction is when a user can communicate with a visualization and in turn it reacts to the users input. An article posted by HEAVYAI best encapsulates this concept, “Interactive data visualization refers to the use of modern data analysis software that enables users to directly manipulate and explore graphical representations of data.” (HEAVY.AI, 2022)
      <p> <br>
          Data visualization employs visual aids to assist analysts in understanding the relevance of data in an efficient and effective manner. Interactive data visualization software expands on this principle by including interactive capabilities that allow for the changing of data visualization parameters, allowing the user to see more information, produce new insights, raise engaging questions, and capture the full value of the data. (HEAVY.AI, 2022)  </p>
      <p> <br>
            Now with these ideas in mind, we turn back to Dimara & Perin, albeit not their paper, but instead a conference the pair did for InfoVis 2019, wherein in many of the ideas from the paper orignated. I turn to this resource as the reading is very academic heavy and some concepts do allude me, so for the purpose of best explaining the concepts and distilling the ideas, we can use this video in conjunction to the reading. Perin, defines Interaction for visualization as “the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent.” (Dimara & Perin, 2019). Dimara makes an important observation with regards to how the pair formulated their own definition.  </p>
            <p> <br>
              According to Dimara, of the academics texts they examined, many if not most derived a “mainstream” view of interaction in data visualisation, one where interaction is seen as a “dialogue” between an “analyst” and “visualization system”. (Dimara & Perin, 2019)  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              One of Dimara & Perin’s provocations is that this view is limited. Limited in the sense that  there is rarely ever research done on interaction within the context of data visualization, and when it is done, it is focused on implementation rather than the underlying design of said implementation. The second limitation is that of modalities, and how many papers have a very reductionist and outdated idea regarding the modalities users can utilize, often adopting the mentality that data visualization must always be computer or digitally based.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              To combat this Dimara & Perin assume a more “technologically agnostic” (Dimara & Perin, 2019) approach of replacing ‘visualization system’ with ‘data interface’, which according to them includes non-computerized visualizations as well.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Another issue Dimara & Perin bring up is the lack of an established vocabulary, claiming that the vocabulary associated with data visualization is inconsistent and polysemic, as words are often conflated with another and used interchangeably.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Last but not least, intent. Dimara & Perin believe that there is no agreed concept of what intent is, and how it plays a role in the visualisation pipeline.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              According to Dimara & Perin there are two distinct arguments in this regard, on the one end, some argue that intent isn’t personalized or tailored to human experience because there is too much focus placed upon data, tasks and the domains these inhabit, instead of “human goals”. Inversely, some say there is far too much focus placed on operationalizing intent, and that we ignore engagement, gamification and playfulness.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Finally, one of the most glaring issues is how rigid many data visualisations are. It would appear as though many visualisation systems are not geared for flexibility. These tend to manifest themselves in a lack of expressing complex data queries, input new data, freely organising elements of the layout, allow users to choose their own statistical models, etc.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Dimara & Perin turn to the field of HCI, wherein interaction is considered as a distinct concept from an interface. Several concepts emerging from HCI can assist in extending our understanding of interaction. HCI provides several methods for user inclusivity, it creates a space where “novices and experts can co-exist” (Dimara & Perin, 2019). Dimara and Perin apply this idea to their definition of interaction, by replacing the word ‘analyst’ with ‘person’.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Dimara & Perin then outline key differences between VIS and HCI, the first and most distinct difference however is the role of the data, VIS will always be illustrating a data source to a user, HCI may contain a data source. This opens the fundamental differences between the two.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Entities at play: Interaction in HCI always contains two entities (computer and user). VIS contains computers, users as well as the “data entity” (Dimara & Perin, 2019) .  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Performance focus: HCI uses easy and intuitive tools to minimize effort and maximize performance, on the other hand, VIS aims to prompt users into thinking and reflecting on the data be observed,  creating knowledge with mental models.  </p>

               <p> <br>
              
              In conclusion, this reading was extremely dense, large parts of it went over my head and it took me several instances of re-reading it and breaking down. That being said, one of the biggest criticisms I have was the content. Not necessarily what was being said but rather how, I felt that this reading in particular was not as accessible as most of the previous readings. This reading had a rather steep curve in terms of understanding its main ideas. One section in particular that was a fairly dense challenge was the Classifying Actions section on page 9. This section in and of itself is a lot to grapple with and then Dimara & Perin add an extra layer of complexity with their use of other works they have cited. Much like Li’s ‘Overview Of Data Visualization’, I personally felt as though concepts became a lot more difficult to grasp because it seemed like one needed to have at least engaged with the referenced material. One such instance of this I believe could be on page 10, “Interaction also has a cost.” Instead of explicitly telling us, the reader, what exactly this cost is, it remains illusory and just out of our grasp.  </p>
              
              
               <p> <br>
              I think what would have gone a long way in catching the reader up to speed may have been the following, “As Dix summarized interaction design for appropriation, “You may not be able to design for the unexpected, but you can design to allow the unexpected” Here we can see what is being referenced, and it therefore informs the rest of a reader’s understanding.  I will say though that the reading is extremely informative, and it is very interesting to hear the processes involved in extrapolating the data that the pair would use in preparation for this paper. I found it particularly insightful how the pair broke down most of the facets of this paper into smaller digestible sub-headings, in reference to my point above, there is still the issue of the writing being dense despite being broken down.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              One observation I made while doing research is how well the conference video compliments and even supplements the essay. I found the video to be helpful as given this was meant to be a conference, there clearly wasn’t much room for Dimara or Perin to be verbose or overly academic in their descriptions. So where the reading is just long walls of text that spans over two pages, the video takes these concepts and illustrates them in Layman’s terms. The result is beautiful one can have, a shortened version for recap purpose, and once done with the essay. Or a much more concisely worded presentation to use as a means of decoding the essay.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              Personally I was part of the latter group and used the video to inform a lot of my orientation regarding what perspectives I should adopt before engaging with this essay.  </p>
              
               <p> <br>
              In conclusion, I do not feel entirely confident that I have given enough of an in-depth reflection regarding this essay, as I mentioned before this reading was definitely one of the more challenging ones, if not the most challenging one we have done so far. I will say, the few parts of the essay I understood I enjoyed reading and I did learn a few new concepts and ideas, namely how interaction operates within a data visualisation modality and how HCI can facilitate this process a lot better.  </p>
