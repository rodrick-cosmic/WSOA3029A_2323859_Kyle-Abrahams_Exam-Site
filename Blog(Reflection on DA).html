            A CRITICAL REFLECTION ON MY DATA ART

    <p>
        <p> <br> Data-driven artwork is a concept that I only recently heard about, but that does not mean I had no knowledge about it, only that I knew it by a different name. </p>

<p> <br> A few years ago, high-school to be exact for our Geography class we watch this one video titled, “art made of storms”. It was a TedTalk video which honestly my younger self could not have cared less for. However, one aspect of the video that always stuck with me was how before the woman hosting the talk even spoke there was this haunting musical composition that played. My geographer teacher at the time told us we should watch it and think about it in the context of GIS and how powerful geographical data is. All these years later, I now know that I was watching a TedTalk on data visualization or more specifically ‘data art’. </p>

<p> <br> Data Art, more commonly known as ‘data-driven art’, is an artistic form that uses datasets to create visual stimuli. The sculpture has a more objective reality behind its creation because it is based on data and does not exclusively originate from the artist's imagination. </p>
<p> <br> Furthermore, to be considered data art, the data used to create the piece should be understandable to the audience with proper explanations even if the meaning is not obvious at first glance. This contrasts with data visualization, which seeks to be an effective representation of data into visual elements, and generative art, which relies on randomness, often found in nature, to elicit emotions. </p>
<p> <br> So in keeping with my Matrix theme I decided to have a small section dedicated to semi-experimental stuff and some more grounded visualizations. </p>
<p> <br> Ultimately, I narrowed it down to two distinct data art possibilities, one would be an artwork generated with ASCII, or an artwork that could best encapsulate that matrix feeling. I was thinking of having a 3D recreation of one of the movie’s environments. </p>
<p> <br> Why I chose ASCII and what I wanted to achieve with it was creating the atmosphere of the code being used to represent objects as seen in the movies that they are heavily informed by. ASCII I felt, was also the perfect candidate to represent any visuals because “each of the characters is assigned a denary (decimal) character code, which is represented and stored in the computer as binary” and as you know the movies use binary code to represent the simulation of the matrix. </p>
<p> <br> In terms of engaging with the ‘data set’, I think my project is exempt from this question because for the most part the ‘data set’ I am using mainly ASCII data and not a particular data set, oh say a library or a set of statistics. I think as nice as it would be to use a data set, I personally don’t think that that is the direction I want to take with my website. I think it would have been far more different if my website was based around something a lot less thematic, perhaps something along the lines of African presidents with the most presidential terms served. </p>
<p> <br> But again that was not something I felt would tie into my theme or my aesthetic. </p>
<p> <br> Now the question becomes, how does this data art and its data set add, subtract or even subvert meaning? </p>
<p> <br> I think the data art enhances the websites overall meaning, in two significant ways. Firstly it enhances it in the sense that from a creative point of view, it is obvious that this is the most fitting and even ideal artwork I could have used because it encapsulates the aesthetic of the matrix so perfectly, by blending the visuals of the matrix and real life code. Which on a technical level is impressive because it demonstrates how easy it is for our brains to recognise shapes and forms from simple strings of text. </p>
<p> <br> But on a technical level in relation to this course (and the assignment), I think using ASCII as the data is significant because it is the basis of fundamental data transfers, ASCII provides a generally acknowledged and understood character set. It helps developers to create interfaces that are understandable by both people and machines. ASCII was the initial important data processing character encoding standard. Unicode, commonly known as the Unicode Worldwide Character Standard, is used by the majority of current computer systems. It is a standard for character encoding that includes ASCII encodings. </p>
<p> <br> Planning (or lack thereof) </p>
<p> <br> For this step, I didn’t really look into many options because many of the data art examples I found while doing research weren’t really ones that appealed to me but I think there were a few really helpful bits of research I found. One such example was an online text to image converter. I think is the thing that really got me to consider using ASCII data art as the backbone of this. I think another bit I found particularly fascinating was how ASCII works in a 3D space, especially if it’s interactive. </p>
