                        For the first time in this course, I finally feel confident in my ability, and I finally feel like all the things I have learnt are starting to pay off. I am getting ahead of myself, what I mean to say is that I feel that I am finally starting to create the websites that I wanted to create when I first joined the course, but I had no idea where to start. So what does this have to do with my UI & UX reflection? The answer is fairly simple, it has everything to do with it. </p>
                        
                        <p> <br> One of the aspects I felt the most restricted in was the portfolio website, for good reason, it would be unprofessional to have it as a much less structured design in favour of a more abstract and illusory one. Granted, it isn’t impossible, it is probably not advised. 
                        <p> <br> As such the design had certain expectations tied to it, and certain standards if you will, it is the concept that an online store will no doubt be much different than an online blog. Because each website has certain design principles exclusive to them. 
                        <p> <br> So to hark back to my point of my portfolio website, I felt like it was much safer to make it as plain and boring as I could, however with this submission I went in with a different outlook, this time around I wanted to really push an experimental design, something that looked chaotically structured. </p>
                        <p> <br> I found that while research for this assignment there were so many possible website ideas I could have explored, one of which was threejs. because to this day I want to build a website using 3D models, because it’s something I am extremely passionate about. 
                        <p> <br> I digress, one of the sites that I took a lot of inspiration from was the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided official website, which as of writing this was unfortunately taken down,  I think one of the elements that stood out to me the most was how it was just so-plain. 
                        <p> <br> But do not get me wrong I do not mean plain as in it was empty, but rather it was populated strategically, that is to say the UI was placed in such a way it felt almost seamless, and this was one of the key design tenets I wanted to retain. </p>
        
                        <p> <br> I wanted the design to reflect two very distinct feelings, firstly I wanted it to have an almost future-retro feel to it, where the bad design is more there as a love letter than a lazy oversight, I wanted it to look like an early 2000s website, the ones that would have been around when The Matrix was released. </p>
                        <p> <br> Secondly, I wanted it to feel like a very bare bones “hacker-esque” site, so much so I even thought of having the website being styled after a terminal with basic commands and everything. </p>
                        <p> <br> The problem, if you haven’t picked up on it already, was simple. </p>
        
                        <p> <br> For both of these ideas the UI would have been virtually non-existent, and the UX would have been a truly dreadful one. You don’t need to be a UI pro to know that the early 00s websites were some of the most nauseating things that one could ever see, the UI was badly misplaced, the text was never consistent and worse yet, in modern day many of those sites are used as a warning of how not to design your website. 
                        <p> <br> I must admit, even the original Matrix website represents a dated visual design and using it is a chore. It works well as a novelty sure, but I realised my site is and cannot be a novelty it needs to serve a functional purpose. </p>
                        <p> <br> Which brings me to the terminal site idea, one which I was so set on, but unfortunately it presented the issue of functionality, and even usability, it was far too niche for the average person, especially one who had no knowledge or interest in programming, granted the same could be said for basing my entire website of The Matrix, but then again, who doesn’t know The Matrix. So I had to make a tough decision and kill off my strongest idea. In doing so however I was able to start exploring more alternatives that could help. </p>
        
                        <p> <br> So I thought what better way to get inspiration than to look back at your older work, so I did, and I realised that there were a lot of elements that worth improving upon because of how well they worked in the previous submissions. I looked specifically at the design regarding the site’s layout and started thinking, “how can I simplify this?” and so from that I started experimenting with my old site and began peeling away at all the otherwise useless elements. It was a very insightful experience because it helped me understand what would be deemed absolutely necessary for a websites UX and from there I could see what aspects I could afford to get rid of. </p>
                        <p> <br> One of the key things I noticed was, how so much of my previous website was inhabited by empty space, and that the design was not uniform, and it created a really disjointed feeling, the most obvious part of this was in my styleguide, it looked absolutely appalling, so this time around I wanted it to be simple, and retain the picture and text format, but tweak it to be much neater and uniform. </p>
                        <p> <br> I think this is one of the more important takeaways I had, it was ,regardless of how the website was designed, it needed to be uniform, hence why I mention the ‘chaotic structure’ because for me I wanted the website to have a bare bones feeling, but that bare bones feeling would be as a result of how minimalistic the design was and not because it felt empty. </p>
                        <p> <br> In truth I repurposed a lot of my previous code and tried to distil it into something much more digestible and user-friendly, and the idea was that doing so would foster much smoother interaction and also fully immerse the user in the experience of the site, because fundamentally that is what I wanted to focus on tailoring an experience.  </p>
