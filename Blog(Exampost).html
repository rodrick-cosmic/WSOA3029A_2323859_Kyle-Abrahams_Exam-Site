<p> <br> “…we live immersed in representation: it is how we understand our environments and each other. It is also how we both are, and how we understand ourselves; representation is implicated in the process of me becoming me.” (Webb, 2009:2)
    <p> <br>For as long as humans have existed communication has been employed both verbally and visually. Be that through body language or even illustrations such as rock paintings, a large part of humans’ understanding of the world is through visual means, so much so that “the brain itself, [has] neurons devoted to visual processing number in the hundreds of millions and take up about 30 % of the cortex, as compared with 8 % for touch and just 3 % for hearing” (Romih, 2016). 
    <p> <br> So then the question becomes how best can we effectively communicate large data sets and condense them into digestible bits of information? The obvious answer would be data visualization, but what if we could take this a step further and utilize artistic practices to make the data not only digestible but also accessible and enjoyable to process? The following essay aims to explore the strategies of representation employed by data visualization and data art and how they relate and differ from one another.
    <p> <br> In order to understand what exactly data visualization is, a definition is needed. Viégas and Wattenberg claim that “Data visualization is usually viewed as a tool to support analytic reasoning” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007:2). While this definition works I believe it deserves a bit more nuance. In addition to supporting analytic reasoning, DV also seeks to graphical display information and data using visual components like charts, graphs and maps to give an easy method of observing and analyzing trends, outliers, and patterns among data. Additionally, it also allows workers or entrepreneurs to deliver facts to non-technical audiences without creating confusion.
    <p> <br> As a digression, it is worth mentioning that Data visualizations and infographics are frequently mistaken. A casual viewer may not see the differences, and there is a lot of disinformation out there. It is usually assumed that these two are diametrically opposed, yet they are not. Both are graphic data representations. (Tableau, 2019)
    <p> <br> A key distinction is that data visualization is a single object (such as a map, graph, chart, or diagram), but an infographic frequently includes numerous data visualizations. A second significant distinction is that infographics include extra components like stories and images. Aside from that, extra effort is usually put into the design of infographics in order to make them more effective and aesthetically beautiful.
    <p> <br> It is important to note that Jenny Kidd says developing greater aesthetically pleasing ways of big data analysis is not the only purpose of data visualization tools (Kidd, 2016:13). Which arguably is in stark contrast to data art, whose sole purpose is to be aesthetically pleasing, albeit even if it is in the slightest. Data-Art can be understood as an artistic approach that depends on the use of a dataset/s to transmit feelings to a spectator. Given that it is predicated on statistics, the artwork reflects a more objective truth behind its creation and is not just the artist's idea (Benzi, 2020). This also raises the first point of difference between the two. 
    
    
    
    <p> <br> What is the connection between data and art? We are accustomed to viewing data science as an austere, scientific field that does not always correspond to the artistic freedom sought by artists. The bulk of individuals who undertake data visualization focuses on dashboards created for reporting reasons. The art of data, according to Nicholas Rougeux, is defined by an inherent relationship with emotions. In contrast, traditional data visualization focuses on information, data display, and learning. (Fauvelle, 2020)
    <p> <br>  [Data art] is the presentation of data in a unique way to evoke an emotional reaction, therefore exploring the creative side and the many methods of processing data. 
    <p> <br> To be termed data art, the data utilized to make the piece must be understood by the audience with correct interpretations, regardless of whether the message is not evident at first glance. It contrasts with data visualization, which aims to be an accurate representation of data in visual elements, and generative art, which elicits emotions through unpredictability, which is typically seen in nature. Data art is defined by an inextricable link with feelings. In contrast, traditional data visualization emphasizes information, data display, and understanding. In the Kidd article, she references McCosker and Wilken and says while visually appealing, data visualization approaches can be "presented in such a scale and speed that understanding is challenging." (Kidd, 2016)
    <p> <br> This I believe does not mean that data art is more coherent or understandable but rather, that due to its objective nature it has more leeway in terms of being presented in a scale and speed that may be misunderstood because it is after all largely entertainment.
    <p> <br> Another difference between the two modes is a bit less obvious. But before, answering this, a better question is why is a distinction necessary?
    <p> <br> As mentioned prior there are two independent techniques for graphically displaying data today: data visualization and data art, and the two seldom intersect. They differ in both purpose and design and a failure to differentiate between the two runs the risk of confusion, or misinterpretation.
    <p> <br> There are just as many meanings of data visualization as there are determiners, but at the heart of this long-standing phrase is the desire to depict data in a way that leads to comprehension. It must inform anything else it does. If we accept this as a fundamental concept of data visualization, we may evaluate every example based on how clearly, comprehensively, and precisely it informs.
    <p> <br> As Stephen Few, a data visualization consultant notes, if the goal is to assist a certain set of individuals to comprehend anything, data art, no matter how brilliantly produced, is not acceptable. If the goal is to amuse or engage an audience in an emotional experience, data visualization is usually not the way to go. If both objectives must be met, then a thoroughly informative and artistically pleasing representation would be appropriate. Although it is quite simple to make any data visualization aesthetically attractive, making one wonderful requires considerable expertise as a visual designer and information communicator.
    <p> <br> So it is fair to say so far the strategies of representation are different, and thus so are the affordances and even the objectives, in summary, it could be said data visualization aims solely to inform while data art instead aims to be “visually engaging” (Fauvelle, 2020)
    <p> <br> Furthermore, we could break the differences down in more layman’s terms. (I will use the abbreviations DV and DA for data visualization and data art respectively) Complexity, DA is generally straightforward and aimed toward the broad public. The complexity in DV ranges from basic data sets to more intricate scientific graphics. 
    <p> <br>Naturally, DA has a lot of effort put into the design and making it aesthetically pleasing. Whereas with DV, given most are created automatically using software design is not necessarily the focus; however, if distributed or included in a presentation, more care is taken with the design.
    <p> <br> As a general rule DA are almost never static pictures. What is known as interactive digital-driven artworks is more commonly referred to as "interactive data stories," which are essentially interactive data visualizations combined with narrative.
    <p> <br> This represents the potential of data visualization, especially in web-based data visualizations.
    <p> <br> Another important factor to consider is what concerns data visualizations and data-art raise. Off the bat, there is the environmental concern that anything digital raises in that “digital activity uses a large amount of data…” (Ehrmann, 2022). Digital technologies have altered the marketing environment as a result of data abundance. As a direct result, serious privacy concerns have disrupted consumer interactions, spurring changes in both legislative initiatives and people's own privacy-protective behaviours. 
    <p> <br> As a closing note, I wanted to speak a bit about ODI and their initiative, “Data as Culture”
    <p> <br> The Open Data Institute's world-class contemporary art program, Data as Culture, displays and commissions artworks that employ data as a medium. It seeks to broaden the public's awareness of data and how it might alter and reflect our lives. When the Open Data Institute (ODI) was founded in 2012, the founders recognized that data may be perceived as uninteresting and challenging to interact with. Data as Culture was created with the goal of assisting the ODI and its direct and wider audiences in considering the larger consequences of data, as well as the associated social and cultural settings. It posed the question of how we may experience data in a multimodal manner rather than simply being informed by it.
    <p> <br> Data as Culture encourages individuals to analyse how we interact with and think regarding data, and how we might use data to probe key challenges of our times, and to explore the real effect – both advantages and disadvantages – that data may create.
    <p> <br> I mention this initiative in light of Sabine Roeser’s reflection on how art can open up a discourse on ethical practices in and amongst the art. I believe it is an often overlooked aspect that far too often is ignored, and so I think going forward we should advocate for more initiatives like ‘Data As Culture’. But also ways in which we can use data visualizations to inform and educate people with real stats and illustrate the consequences of certain points of investigation.
